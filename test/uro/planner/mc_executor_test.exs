  Verification for the plain-Elixir port of `standalone/tw_mc_executor.hpp`
  (RFD 0034). The RNG is Erlang's `:rand`, not the original's
  `std::mt19937_64` -- these tests pin probability-1.0 (always succeeds,
  since `:rand.uniform_s/1` draws are always < 1.0) and probability-0.0
  (never succeeds, since no draw is < 0.0) edges rather than exact draw
  sequences, so they hold regardless of which RNG backs `:rand`.
