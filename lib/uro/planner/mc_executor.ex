defmodule Uro.Planner.MCExecutor do
  @moduledoc """
  Hand-ported from `standalone/tw_mc_executor.hpp` into plain Elixir --
  same reasoning as `Uro.Planner.Replan` (RFD 0030): domain actions are
  an injected `%{name => (state, args -> state | nil)}` map (matching
  `Replan`'s own `action_fn` contract) rather than re-deriving domain
  loading, since that's `Uro.Planner.SandboxAdapter`'s job, not this
  module's.

  Unlike the original, this module does NOT round-trip state through
  JSON strings -- state is a plain map throughout, and each step's
  post-state is returned as that map directly (`nil` when the step
  didn't succeed), since nothing here crosses a language boundary.

  The RNG is Erlang's built-in `:rand` (`exsss` algorithm), not a
  hand-rolled `std::mt19937_64` -- this module is a stochastic
  what-if simulator, not verified game logic, so bit-identical draws
  against the C++ oracle are not a goal (the C++ port itself already
  diverges from the upstream Python `mc_executor.py`'s Mersenne
  Twister draws, since `std::mt19937_64` and CPython's 32-bit
  `random` are different generators). Determinism *within* Elixir
  (same seed -> same sequence) is what callers actually need, and
  `:rand.seed_s/2` + `:rand.uniform_s/1` provide exactly that.

  Executes `plan` against `init_state`, drawing one uniform(0,1) sample
  per step and comparing against that step's success probability
  (`probs` at the same index, default `1.0`). A step "succeeds" when
  the draw is below its probability AND (if the action name is known)
  applying it doesn't return `nil`. Stops at the first failed step.

  Mirrors the original's one quirk exactly: if the drawn outcome is a
  success but the action name isn't in `actions`, the step is still
  recorded as succeeded with the state left unchanged (the C++ code
  has no `else` branch on a failed lookup).

  `opts`: `:probs` (default `[]`, meaning every step defaults to 1.0),
  `:seed` (default `10`, matching the Python original's default),
  `:actions` (required).
