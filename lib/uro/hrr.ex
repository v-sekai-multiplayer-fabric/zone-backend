  @moduledoc """
  Pure-Elixir Holographic Reduced Representation / Vector Symbolic
  Architecture primitives (Plate 1995; bipolar MAP-B variant, per Kanerva
  2009's survey of VSA families).

  No NIF, no cross-language boundary. A separate phase-based HRR exists
  as `Uro.Planner.HRR` (RFD 0032, ported from the now-retired
  `standalone/tw_hrr.hpp`) for planner fact retrieval -- that module's
  algebra is deliberately not reused here, since this one is bipolar
  MAP-B, a different VSA family for a different purpose (semantic
  tagging, not retrieval scoring). A Lean4-verified core
  (`openusd-fabric/lean/Fabric/HRR.lean`, same algorithm, fixed-point) was
  built first and stays as a real, independently-verified artifact, but
  routing zone-backend through it would need a NIF bridge with no working
  precedent in this org. Plain Elixir is the simplest thing that's
  actually correct: real circular-convolution `bind`, not the pointwise
  `+`/`-` `weft-warp-loop`'s `taskweft-hrr.shrub` port used.

  Vectors are plain lists of `@dim` floats, each an ordinary Elixir float
  -- no fixed-point scaling needed here (that convention exists for the
  org's formally-verified, cross-platform-bit-exact Lean kernels; this is
  an application-level tagging feature, not one of those).
