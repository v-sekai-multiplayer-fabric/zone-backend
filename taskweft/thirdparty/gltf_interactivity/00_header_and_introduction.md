# Introduction

## General

This document, referred to as the “glTF Interactivity Extension
Specification” or just the “Specification” hereafter, describes the
`KHR_interactivity` glTF extension.

This extension aims to enhance glTF 2.0 by adding the ability to encode
behavior and interactivity in 3D assets.

This extension is for single user experiences only and does not deal
with any of the complexity involved in multi-user networked experiences.

## Document Conventions

The glTF Interactivity Extension Specification is intended for use by
both implementers of the asset exporters or converters (e.g., digital
content creation tools) and application developers seeking to import or
load interactive glTF assets, forming a basis for interoperability
between these parties.

Specification text can address either party; typically, the intended
audience can be inferred from context, though some sections are defined
to address only one of these parties.

Any requirements, prohibitions, recommendations, or options defined by
[normative terminology](#introduction-normative-terminology) are imposed
only on the audience of that text.

### Normative Terminology and References

The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHALL**, **SHALL
NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, **RECOMMENDED**, **MAY**, and
**OPTIONAL** in this document are to be interpreted as described in [BCP
14](#bcp14).

These key words are highlighted in the specification for clarity.

References to external documents are considered normative if the
Specification uses any of the normative terms defined in this section to
refer to them or their requirements, either as a whole or in part.

### Informative Language

Some language in the specification is purely informative, intended to
give background or suggestions to implementers or developers.

If an entire chapter or section contains only informative language, its
title is suffixed with “(Informative)”. If not designated as
informative, all chapters, sections, and appendices in this document are
normative.

All Notes, Implementation notes, and Examples are purely informative.

### Technical Terminology

TBD

### Normative References

specification:

## Motivation and Design Goals (Informative)

glTF 2.0 assets are widely used in various industries, including
automotive, e-commerce, and gaming. There is a growing demand for adding
logic and behavior to glTF assets, particularly in the metaverse. This
extension aims to fulfill this demand by providing a portable, easily
implementable, safe, and visually accessible solution for adding
behavior to glTF assets. The extension is inspired by visual scripting
features of leading game engines and aims to deliver a minimum
meaningful and extensible feature set.

### What Is a Behavior Graph?

A behavior graph is a series of interconnected interactivity nodes that
represent behaviors and interactions in a 3D asset. It can respond to
events and cause changes in the asset’s appearance and behavior.

### What Problems Can They Solve?

Behavior graphs offer a flexible and multi-functional approach to
encoding behavior, making them useful for various applications. For
instance, they can be used to create smart assets with behavior and
interactions, AR experiences with user interactions, and immersive game
levels with dynamic assets and objectives.

### What Do They Not Solve?

Behavior graphs are not designed to handle UI presentation or arbitrary
scripting. Creating a 3D UI using behavior graphs would be complex, not
portable, and not accessible. Similarly, arbitrary scripting is
challenging to make safe, portable across platforms, and has a vast
surface area.

### Comparison with Trigger-Action Lists

Behavior graphs and trigger-action lists are the two common models for
representing and executing behaviors in the digital world. Common 3D
experience commerce tools use trigger-action lists, while behavior
graphs are typically used by high-end game engines. In this section, we
will explore the differences and similarities between these two models,
and explain why glTF chose to adopt behavior graphs.

Behavior graphs and trigger-action lists share common features, such as
being safe and sandboxed, offering limited execution models controlled
by the viewer, and both supporting the “trigger” and “action” operation
categories. However, there are also significant differences between the
two models. Trigger-action lists lack “Queries”, “Logic”, and “Control
Flow” operations, meaning that sophisticated behavior based on queries,
logic, or control flow branches is not possible. This lack of
functionality greatly affects the ability to create complex behavior and
control structures and rules out the implementation of advanced control
flow structures in the future.

On the other hand, behavior graphs are a superset of trigger-action
lists, meaning that the former can support everything that
trigger-action lists can, and more. Behavior graphs support “Queries”,
“Logic” and “Control Flow” operations, making them more expressive and
capable of creating more sophisticated behaviors. This makes behavior
graphs the preferred method of choice for high-end game engines, as it
offers an identical safety model as trigger-action lists while being
more expressive.

### Turing Completeness

The execution model and operation choices for this extension mean that
it is Turing-complete. This means that an implementation of this can
execute any computation and it is not always possible to predict if it
will run forever, e.g., halt or not.

While this may present security implications, it is not a major
hindrance and can be safely mitigated so that any implementation does
not become susceptible to denial of services by badly behaving behavior
graphs, whether intentional or not.

The main way to mitigate the risk of non-halting behavior graphs is to
limit the amount of time given to them for execution, both in terms of
individual time slice as well as overall execution time.
