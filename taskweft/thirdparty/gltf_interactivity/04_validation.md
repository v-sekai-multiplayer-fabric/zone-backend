# Validation (Informative)

This section describes steps needed to check validity of the
interactivity extension object according to the normative language of
the previous sections and the corresponding JSON schemas.

## Validation Glossary

This section uses the following terms:

assert  
continue iff the associated condition is true; otherwise *reject the
extension*

JSON index  
a non-negative JSON number less than 2147483648 that is exactly
representable as an integer, e.g., JSON numbers `2`, `2.0`, and `0.2e1`
are exactly representable as integer two

reject the extension  
the whole interactivity extension object is invalid and thus cannot be
used

reject the graph  
the behavior graph is invalid and thus cannot be used; this has no
effect on other graphs defined in the extension

## Extension Object Validation

1.  *Assert* that the interactivity extension object has the `graphs`
    property that is a non-empty JSON array having no more than
    2147483648 elements.

        array length,
